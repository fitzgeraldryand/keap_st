## Feature Highlights

### Note Creation

At the heart of Keap St.'s functionality is note creation. To create a note, users click on the below place holder Note Form:

Despite giving the appearance of being an input field, itself, and the mouse's becoming an i-beam text cursor while hovering on it, this Note Form actually functions more like a button: it is not possible to type directly in it and only when the user clicks on it are they show the actual input areas.
